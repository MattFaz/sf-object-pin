## Overview

The Salesforce Object Manager tab is frequently used by Salesforce Administrators and Developers, however currently there is no way to pin your favorite _(or most frequently visited)_ objects to the top.

This Chrome Extension aims to provide an easy way to pin your most used objects by adding a Pin to each row and when selected, adding it as a buttom at the top of the Object Manager table.
